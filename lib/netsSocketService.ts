/**
 * Socket.IO client for the local SSD Nets-Service EXE — the same protocol
 * HEB's Admin-Frontend/User-Frontend-POS socketService.ts already talks to
 * (terminal:status / terminal:logon / terminal:payment:nets, ack-callback
 * style, plus PAYMENT_MESSAGE/STATUS_MESSAGE/LOGON_MESSAGE realtime
 * events) — see SSD's Nets-Service SOCKET_COMMANDS_REFERENCE.md, unchanged
 * from HEB's. Always localhost: the EXE runs on the same till/counter PC as
 * whichever browser tab is showing this page, never a deployed origin.
 *
 * Deliberately smaller than HEB's version — no payment-lock timeout,
 * command queueing, or throttling (SSD doesn't yet trigger NETS payments
 * from this app — see MODULE comment in useNetsTerminalConnection.ts).
 * Kept: the connection-candidate fallback, ack + response-event dual
 * listening, and the ACK-vs-realtime status normalization split, since
 * that split is what stops a plain "request accepted" ACK from being
 * misread as "terminal is online".
